Section will generate and render the 3D model for you\r\nautomatically, and provide you with various ways of interacting with the model.\r\n\r\nthreejs-section requires an HTML5 compatible browser and the following third\r\nparty libraries:\r\n\r\n  * threejs\r\n  * threejs-csg\r\n\r\nStable releases are tagged following the Semantic Versioning standard. All\r\nother commits should be treated as non-stable.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elmarquez/section.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elmarquez/section)\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking a Model\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nNotes forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Section with Angular.js\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nNotes forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nA number of examples are available inside the /examples folder. To run these\r\nexamples you will first need to download and install all development\r\ndependencies, as describing below in the Development section. Once you have\r\ninstalled the dependencies, start the development web server in the examples\r\nfolder as follows:\r\n\r\n    grunt connect::keepalive\r\n\r\nOpen a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nTo build the library or run the examples, you will need to install the\r\nfollowing build dependencies:\r\n\r\n  * nodejs - http://www.nodejs.org\r\n  * grunt - http://www.gruntjs.com\r\n  * bower - http://www.bower.io\r\n\r\nInstall Nodejs first, then install Grunt and Bower globally as follows:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g grunt grunt-cli\r\n    npm install -g bower\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the build dependencies, download and install all\r\nlibrary dependencies as follows:\r\n\r\n    npm install\r\n    bower install\r\n\r\nType `grunt` inside the project folder to see the list of build commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPlease see the LICENSE file for copyright and license information.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Do\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe following features are planned:\r\n\r\n  * Frame layout\r\n  * Mouse over assembly layer or element initiates animated fade out of other elements\r\n  * Provide event hooks into Section to select elements from external code\r\n  * Angular.js example showing integration with a table listing of the assembly elements\r\n  * Demo page\r\n  * Various layout algorithms for unitized materials\r\n  * Add lighting with shadows\r\n  * Center view orbit on model center\r\n  * Annotations\r\n  * View aids: rulers, grids\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
