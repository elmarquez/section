Threejs-Section
===============

Section is a library that makes it easy to generate 3D visualizations
of typical building wall, floor and roof assemblies. Define your building
assembly in a JSON object or file using a simple format. Section will then
generate the 3D model for you automatically and provide you with a variety of
functions that support interaction and connection of the model to other
resources.

Threejs-section requires an HTML5 compatible browser and the following third
party libraries:

  * threejs
  * threejs-csg
